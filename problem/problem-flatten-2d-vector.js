/**
 * Flatten 2D Vector
 *
 * Implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: 2d vector =
 * [
 *   [1,2],
 *   [3],
 *   [4,5,6]
 * ]
 * Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 * Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false,
 *              the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,2,3,4,5,6].
