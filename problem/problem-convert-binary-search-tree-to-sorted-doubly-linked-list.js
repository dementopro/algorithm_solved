/**
 * Convert Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly Linked List
 *
 * Convert a BST to a sorted circular doubly-linked list in-place. Think of the left and right pointers as synonymous
 * to the previous and next pointers in a doubly-linked list.
 *
 * We want to transform this BST into a circular doubly linked list. Each node in a doubly linked list has a
 * predecessor and successor. For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last
 * element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.
