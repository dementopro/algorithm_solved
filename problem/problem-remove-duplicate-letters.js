/**
 * Remove Duplicate Letters
 *
 * Given a string which contains only lowercase letters, remove duplicate letters so that
 * every letter appear once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest
 * in lexicographical order among all possible results.
 *
 * Also make sure you keep the original order.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: "bcabc"
 * Output: "abc"
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: "cbacdcbc"
 * Output: "acdb"
