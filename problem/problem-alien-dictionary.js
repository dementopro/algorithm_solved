/**
 * Alien Dictionary
 *
 * There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. The order among letters are known to you and sorted.
 * You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, write a program to verify whether the words
 * are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * The order of the letters is "cba", the list of words is ["cc", "ab", "ca"]
 * Your program should return false, because "ca" should be in front of "ab".
 *
 * Note:
 * You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
