/**
 * Search a 2D Matrix II
 *
 * Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
 *
 * Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
 * Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
 * Example:
 *
 * Consider the following matrix:
 *
 * [
 *   [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
 *   [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
 *   [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
 *   [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
 *   [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
 * ]
 *
 * Given target = 5, return true.
 * Given target = 20, return false.
 *
 * Solution
 *
 * If we stand on the top-right corner of the matrix and look diagonally,
 * it's kind of like a BST, we can go through this matrix to find the target like how we traverse the BST.
