/**
 * Shortest Path in Maze
 *
 * Given a matrix represents a maze, X is the starting point, Y is the destination,
 * # is wall, now you can walk in four directions: up, down, left, right, what is
 * the minimum steps to get to Y from X?
 *
 * For example, we have the following maze:
 *
 *     . X . # . .
 *     . . . . # .
 *     . # . . . .
 *     . # # . . .
 *     . # Y . . .
 *     . . . . . #
 *
 * the minimum steps to reach Y from X is 7.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(mn)
