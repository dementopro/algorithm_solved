/**
 * K-th ancestor of a node in Binary Tree
 *
 * Given a binary tree in which nodes are numbered from 1 to n.
 * Given a node and a positive integer K.
 * We have to print the K-th ancestor of the given node in the binary tree.
 * If there does not exist any such ancestor then print -1.
 *
 * For example in the below given binary tree, 2nd ancestor of node 4 and 5 is 1.
 * 3rd ancestor of node 4 will be -1.
