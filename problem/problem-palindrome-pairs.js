/**
 * Palindrome Pairs
 *
 * Given a list of unique words, find all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) in the given list,
 * so that the concatenation of the two words, i.e. words[i] + words[j] is a palindrome.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Given words = ["bat", "tab", "cat"]
 * Return [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
 * The palindromes are ["battab", "tabbat"]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Given words = ["abcd", "dcba", "lls", "s", "sssll"]
 * Return [[0, 1], [1, 0], [3, 2], [2, 4]]
 * The palindromes are ["dcbaabcd", "abcddcba", "slls", "llssssll"]
 *
 * Solution using Trie
 * Time complexity: O(n * k^2) where k is Where n is the number of words in the list
 * and k is the maximum length that is checked for palindrome.
 *
 * An intuitive brute force solution time complexity is O(n^2 * k).
